# The exact differentiated recurrence for `H̄` (paper `lem:exact-recurrence`)

The manuscript's Lemma "Exact differentiated recurrence" (`lem:exact-recurrence`)
asserts, for every `r ≥ 3`, the identity (eq. `exact-recurrence`)
```
H̄_{r+1}'(u) = a_r(u) · (H̄_r(u) + ρ_r(u))     for a.e. u ∈ [1, e],
```
where `a_r = E_{r-2}'` and `ρ_r` is the recurrence error of eq. `a-rho`.  This
file formalizes the *identity* half of the lemma (the error bound
eq. `rho-small` is out of scope here; it is proved in `Threshold.lean`
(`rhoDepth_abs_le`) on top of the averaging relation
(`AveragingRelation.lean`)):

* `hasDerivAt_E_full` — the chain-rule factorization `E_r' = a_r · E_{r-1} · E_r`;
* `hasDerivAt_Hbar_succ` — the pointwise identity at every non-breakpoint
  phase (`𝓑` is differentiable there by `lem:B-slopes`);
* `E_breakpoint_phases_countable`, `badPhaseSet_countable` — the exceptional
  phase set is countable, so "almost every `u`" in the paper's statement is
  justified in the strong (countable-exception) sense;
* `hasDerivWithinAt_B_Ioi`, `hasDerivWithinAt_Hbar_succ_Ioi` — at *every*
  phase (breakpoints included) the identity holds for the right derivative,
  because `𝓑` is right-affine with slope `1/m_*` on `[X, g(m_*(X)))`;
* `Hbar_succ_sub_eq_integral` — the integral (fundamental-theorem) form of
  eq. `exact-recurrence`, the form consumed by the iteration lemma
  (`lem:iteration-endpoint-matching`) and the backward-stability argument;
* continuity/monotonicity/Lipschitz facts for `E`, `a`, `𝓑`, `H̄` used above
  and by the downstream consumers.

Note that the differentiated identity needs no
positivity or range restriction on `u` at all — for `r ≥ 3` every quantity
involved (`E_r(u)`, `E_{r-1}(u)`, `a_r(u)`) is automatically positive, so the
paper's restriction to `u ∈ [1, e]` matters only for the (out-of-scope) error
bound, not for eq. `exact-recurrence` itself.

/-! ## Continuity, monotonicity, and Lipschitz bounds

Basic regularity of the ingredients of `lem:exact-recurrence`: the iterated
exponentials `E_j`, the chain-rule factor `a_r`, the concave average `𝓑`
(`1`-Lipschitz by `lem:B-slopes`), and the averaged function `H̄_r`. -/

/-- Each iterated exponential `E_j` is continuous (used for the
absolute-continuity statement implicit in `lem:exact-recurrence`). -/
theorem continuous_E (k : ℕ) : Continuous (E k) := by
  induction k with
  | zero => exact continuous_id
  | succ k ih => exact Real.continuous_exp.comp ih

/-- The chain-rule factor `a_r` of eq. `a-rho` (defined there as `E_{r-2}'`,
which by `hasDerivAt_E` is the product `∏_{j=1}^{r-2} E_j`) is continuous. -/
theorem continuous_a (r : ℕ) : Continuous (a r) :=
  continuous_finsetProd _ fun j _ => continuous_E j

/-- `𝓑` is `1`-Lipschitz, in bundled form (`lem:B-slopes`, "locally absolutely
continuous"; repackaging `B_lipschitz`). -/
theorem lipschitzWith_B : LipschitzWith 1 B :=
  LipschitzWith.mk_one fun X Y => by
    rw [Real.dist_eq, Real.dist_eq]
    exact B_lipschitz Y X

/-- `𝓑` is continuous (from `1`-Lipschitz continuity, `lem:B-slopes`). -/
theorem continuous_B : Continuous B :=
  lipschitzWith_B.continuous

/-- `H̄_r = 𝓑 ∘ E_{r-1}` is continuous — the regularity half of "absolutely
continuous" needed to state `lem:exact-recurrence` in integral form. -/
theorem continuous_Hbar (r : ℕ) : Continuous (Hbar r) :=
  continuous_B.comp (continuous_E (r - 1))

/-- `H̄_r` is (globally) monotone: both `𝓑` (`lem:B-slopes`) and `E_{r-1}` are
monotone. -/

/-! ## The chain-rule factorization `E_r' = a_r · E_{r-1} · E_r`

The derivative computation opening the proof of `lem:exact-recurrence`:
`E_r'(u) = ∏_{j=1}^{r} E_j(u) = a_r(u) · E_{r-1}(u) · E_r(u)` (eq. `a-rho`). -/

/-- The chain-rule factorization of `lem:exact-recurrence`: for `r ≥ 2`,
`E_r'(u) = a_r(u) · E_{r-1}(u) · E_r(u)`, splitting off the top two factors
of the full product `∏_{j=1}^{r} E_j(u)`. -/

/-! ## The pointwise exact recurrence (eq. `exact-recurrence`)

At every phase `u` where `E_r(u)` avoids the breakpoints `g(m)` of `𝓑`, the
paper's identity `H̄_{r+1}'(u) = a_r(u)(H̄_r(u) + ρ_r(u))` holds as a genuine
two-sided derivative; the excluded phase set is countable. -/

/-- Eq. `exact-recurrence` of `lem:exact-recurrence`, pointwise form: for
`r ≥ 3`, at every phase `u` with `E_r(u)` not a breakpoint of `g`,
`H̄_{r+1}'(u) = a_r(u) · (H̄_r(u) + ρ_r(u))`.  Chain rule from
`hasDerivAt_B` (`lem:B-slopes`, eq. `B-prime`) and `hasDerivAt_E_full`,
then the algebra of eq. `a-rho` (`rhoDepth_eq`).  No positivity or range
hypothesis on `u` is needed (see the module docstring). -/

/-- The phases `u` at which `E_r(u)` hits a breakpoint of `g` form a countable
set: `E_r` is (strictly monotone, hence) injective, and the breakpoint set is
countable (`breakpoints_countable`, `lem:B-slopes`).  This justifies the
"for almost every `u`" of `lem:exact-recurrence`. -/

    Set.Countable {u : ℝ | ∃ m, g m = E r u} :=

the exceptional set of the pointwise identity `hasDerivAt_Hbar_succ` on
`(0, ∞)` (`lem:exact-recurrence`, "for almost every `u ∈ [1, e]`"). -/

/-! ## The right derivative at every phase, breakpoints included

`𝓑` is right-affine on `[X, g(m_*(X)))` with slope exactly `1/m_*(X)` — the
right-derivative form of eq. `B-prime` (as the paper states it:
`𝓑₊'(X) = 1/m_*(X)` at every `X ≥ 1`, breakpoints included).  Consequently the
recurrence identity holds for the *right* derivative of `H̄_{r+1}` at every
phase with no exceptional set, which is what the fundamental theorem of
calculus consumes. -/

/-- Right-affineness of `𝓑` (`lem:B-slopes`, right-derivative side): for
`0 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ g(m_*(X))`, the increment is exactly `(Y − X)/m_*(X)` — every
term of paper index `< m_*(X)` is frozen and every later term moves in
full. -/
